Being a co-founder is hard. And we're nowhere near the busiest we'll ever be, or the most stressed we'll ever be... in
fact we're just getting started.

I think the hardest things for me so far are:

- The incredible number of unknowns.
  
  Until we've done significant customer discovery or started bringing in revenue, everything is going to be an educated
  guess (including where to begin with customer discovery).

- Trying to optimize our efficiency.
  
  There are infinite directions we can go in, infinite problems to tackle, infinite areas of research, etc. Having
  never been faced with this many options before, we are forced to base our decisions on what we read online, advice
  from mentors, etc. -- but never on our own experiences. Optimizing one's efficiency is a product of two factors: what
  needs doing and how quickly it can be done. There's plenty of guidance on the former, but without any experience in a
  lot of these areas, the latter is a big question mark for many of these early-stage tasks.

- Strengthening my weaknesses.
  
  For me, part of the draw of starting a company was the thought of wearing many hats. I was excited about
  simultaneously pitching, selling, getting feedback, making strategic decisions, and building a product. In reality, I
  understand that my core strength is building the product. Lately, whenever I find myself wanting or needing to shift
  focus to one of my weaknesses, I worry about the effect it will have on product development. Instead of being excited
  about developing weaknesses, like I thought I would be, I stress about not playing to my strengths and the
  effect that is having on the company as a whole.

None of those are that surprising to me. Here are some things that, for better or worse, have been surprising:

- Differences between co-founders and early employees.

  I used to naively think that early employees get a raw deal because their equity percentages are much lower than
  co-founders', while (if you've hired right) they typically don't really work that much less than the founders, and
  they are almost as influential to the trajectory of the company. In reality, I now see that there is a major
  difference... at least in our case, the three of us are taking a much bigger risk financially and professionally than
  our first employees will be.

  Sure, as an early employee of a startup, you are taking a risk w/r/t job security and usually a salary hit as well,
  but you're (usually) being given equity that you will be able to directly effect by doing good work, any benefits
  associated with the job (e.g. flexible work hours, health insurance), and exciting, engaging work that will further
  your career since you will learn more and do more diverse tasks as part of a startup.
  
  On the flip side, co-founders risk having a massive "hole" on their resumes from the time spent working on the
  startup. Having been a hiring manager before, I'll be honest and admit that seeing that an applicant has attempted to
  start their own company before prompts concerns about whether they are just applying in a short-term capacity so that
  they can leave in a year to give it another shot... as much as it may be unfair for that candidate, it's a valid
  concern for the hiring manager. Co-founders also invest their own money and/or take much bigger salary cuts (as in,
  100%). Hence the larger equity stake. But that's clearly a long-term play. Would you rather have guaranteed money now
  or a minscule chance at money later?

  My advice to early employees who feel like they deserve more equity than they are being offered is to ask themselves
  if they would be willing or able to work for free for closer to founder-level equity. I'd guess that most people
  would have to answer "no" to that one. If you can answer "yes" and you're a risk-taker, and you believe in the
  company, present that option to them! They might consider it. I know I'd probably give up significant equity (that
  vests) for free work at this point in our startup. :)

- Financial worries.

  Personally I've always been a little more willing to take risks than my friends when it comes to money so I wasn't
  too worried about my personal finances when I started this journey, and I'm still not. What I _am_ concerned about is
  my co-founders' finances, the business revenue model, our runway, etc. I'm probably an investor's ideal founder in
  this regard because I tend to worry about other peoples' money more than my own. But I legitimately do worry about it
  and sometimes I have to just take myself back to the basics and remember to Keep It Simple, Stupid. I have to remind
  myself of the characteristics that the three of us (founders) have. We're smart, resourceful, professional,
  hard-working, kind, and have a "hustler's" attitude and therefore it's inevitable that we'll find a way to make
  things work*.

  *Disclaimer: We _have_ to believe this. We have no choice. :)
