OK. Here's the deal. Lately, I've had terrible motivation issues. I've even been dreading, for no good reason, the 15
minute task of writing this short blog post.

But I have noticed something over the past few weeks. The one thing that has been inspiring to me has been helping out
my co-founder and an intern of ours with coding questions they have.

I strongly disagree with the old idiom: [Those who can, do. Those who can't,
teach.](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Those+who+can,+do%3B+those+who+can't,+teach)

I was a TA in college and, in general, I've always strived to share knowledge and advice with more junior developers
whenever I can. I find that by doing this, it helps me remember the core tenets of programming, and helps me remember
to "Keep It Simple, Stupid" in my own code design.

It's no accident that the people I've looked up to throughout my life -- the people who are successful, kind, generous,
and inspirational -- have also been very open and willing to teach.
