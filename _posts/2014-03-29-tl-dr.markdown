### TL;DR Version
------------

I've added TL;DR sections to previous posts. :)

### Not-Long-Enough; Tell Me More Version
------------

One thing I love to see when reading blog posts is a good **TL;DR** section (too long; didn't read -- aka a summary).

With that in mind, I've gone back and updated applicable posts. I also made a lot more words bold or italicized.
According to Google Analytics, most of my traffic comes from Stack Overflow to my tech-related posts. We'll see how
this affects page-view times or bounce rates.
