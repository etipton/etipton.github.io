Welcome to CodeBestowed!

I hope, in time, that reading this blog will become a rewarding and entertaining experience for you.

My primary goals for this blog are:

1. Provide insight into my struggles and triumphs as I attempt to start and grow a software company. (More details on that later...)
- Describe technical challenges that I encounter along the way, and any solutions, if applicable, that I discover.
- Increase my "Internet footprint."
- Become a better and faster writer.

Who am I? Well, until I add an "About Me" page, please see my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-tipton/4/666/a83">LinkedIn profile</a>.

Thanks for reading,

Eric Tipton
