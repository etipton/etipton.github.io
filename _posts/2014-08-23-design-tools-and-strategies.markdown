### TL;DR Version
------------

I updated this site's css.

### Not-Long-Enough; Tell Me More Version
------------

Just finished giving this site a bit of a face-lift. Please let me know your thoughts!

My strategy was simple:
[R&D, aka Rip-off and Duplicate](http://davidcummings.org/2010/06/12/dont-reinvent-the-ui-wheel/) :)

I looked around at clean, simple blogs that I enjoy reading and I stole a little bit here and there...

The trickiest part was picking font styles and colors. For those things, these two tools should be in any web
developer's arsenal:

- [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
- [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/)

IMO, the weakest part of my software engineering "game" is web design, so this has been a fun learning experience for
me and I recommend that all back-end devs start a blog like this one to get a feel for how the "other half" lives. By
"a blog like this one" I mean not WordPress, no purchased themes, etc.

What else? Any other "must-have" tools that designers or front-end engineers use regularly?
