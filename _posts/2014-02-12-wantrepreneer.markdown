My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-tipton/4/666/a83">LinkedIn</a> title <b>wantrepreneer</b> (note the two "ee"s) is meant to imply that I am a software engin<b>eer</b> who <b>want</b>s to break into ent<b>repren</b>eurship.

This is different from a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wantrepreneur">wantrepreneur</a> because it implies that some technical knowledge has been attained. So it is a step above someone who simply wants to start a business with no applicable skillsets / experience.

While it's possible that I've coined this term, it's highly probable that someone else has already thought of it. Regardless, I encourage others to use the term if they like it!
