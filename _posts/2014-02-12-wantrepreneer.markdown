My [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-tipton/4/666/a83) title **wantrepreneer** (note the two "ee"s) is meant to imply that I am a software engin**eer** who **want**s to break into ent**repren**eurship.

This is different from a [wantrepreneur](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wantrepreneur) because it adds the implication that some engineering technical knowledge is desired (or has already been attained).

While it's possible that I've coined this term, it's highly probable that someone else has already thought of it. Regardless, I encourage others to use the term if they like it!
