My [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-tipton/4/666/a83) title **wantrepreneer** (note the two "ee"s) is meant to imply that I am a software engin**eer** who **want**s to break into ent**repren**eurship.

This is different from a [wantrepreneur](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wantrepreneur) because it implies that some technical knowledge has already been attained. So it is a step above someone who simply wants to start a business with no applicable skillsets / experience.

While it's possible that I've coined this term, it's highly probable that someone else has already thought of it. Regardless, I encourage others to use the term if they like it!
